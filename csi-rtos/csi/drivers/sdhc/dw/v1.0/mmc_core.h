accept these Terms on behalf of your company, you may not use the Software and
Synopsys is unwilling to provide you with them.

without Synopsys's consent, the transfer or assignment will be ineffective,
null, and void. For purposes of this Section, a transfer or assignment of your
license rights will be deemed to have occurred (a) if a third party (or group of
third parties acting in concert) acquires beneficial ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of either your assets or of the stock or other equity interests
entitled to vote for your directors or equivalent managing authority, or (b) in
the event of a merger, consolidation or other business combination between you
and one or more third parties where your stockholders immediately before that
transaction own (directly or indirectly), after that transaction, less than
fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for
the directors or equivalent managing authority of the surviving entity. These
Terms constitute the entire understanding and agreement between you and Synopsys
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior
and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, oral or written, express or
implied, regarding the same subject matter.
