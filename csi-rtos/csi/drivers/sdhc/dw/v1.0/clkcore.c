entitled to vote for your directors or equivalent managing authority, or (b) in
the event of a merger, consolidation or other business combination between you
and one or more third parties where your stockholders immediately before that
transaction own (directly or indirectly), after that transaction, less than
fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for
the directors or equivalent managing authority of the surviving entity. These
